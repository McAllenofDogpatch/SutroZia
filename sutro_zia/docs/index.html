          <b>37 Corbett</b>
<p>
Anyone could be forgiven
<br>
for imagining
<br>
the Corbett bus is inspired
<br>
by the slime trail of a delirious snail
<br>
loose on a scale model of Twin Peaks.
<br>
Hard to say for certain
<br>
what exactly the snail ingested
<br>
at the intersection of
<br>
miniature Haight
<br>
and miniature Masonic:
<br>
probably not lettuce.
<br>
Whatever it was, it let that
<br>
tiny gastropod brain
<br>
steer a course as free as its eyestalks.
<br>
If any snail could be said to careen
<br>
it was this one.
<br>
As for the transit planners
<br>
who look to nature for inspiration?
<br>
Anticipating that inevitably buses
<br>
will sometimes crawl through the city
<br>
they sought out a master of the discipline.
<br>
Mucus meanders over the plaster landscape,
<br>
a course crossing itself ten times
<br>
faithfully reproduced on the map,
<br>
the insight of a high snail
<br>
charting Muniâ€™s highest stop.
<br>
Its bulging eyes, on swivels,
<br>
take in every view from the crestline
<br>
before sliding back down
<br>
miniature Market Street
<br>
looking for something
<br>
to eat.

            <b>This is Just To Say</b>
            <p>
I have taken
<br>
the bus
<br>
that goes down
<br>
Geary
<br>
</p>
<p>
and which
<br>
should probably
<br>
have been
<br>
a subway
<br>
</p>
<p>
Forgive me
<br>
the Richmond was
<br>
gloomy
<br>
and so cold
